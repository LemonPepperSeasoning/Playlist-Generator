# Playlist-Generator

idea of this project is to 
1. Scrape internet for different generes of copy-right free music.
2. Group/Create a playlist (roughly 1~2 hours long per playlist)
3. Concatenate into single mp3 file, add a video. (some moving 3d art in loop)
4. Upload to youtube with clickbait titles.
5. Hopefully get views.

The end
